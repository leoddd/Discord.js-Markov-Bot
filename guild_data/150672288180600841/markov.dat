I been on this site for years and I'am sick and tire of everything is a ban fuck you do. like everything the past years I been on here has been you get ban for this and that stupid little humor pointless thread, what is the problem with that. am I'm mistaken how the staff had talked to people on here how rude they can be and such for years I saw staff being rude and strict for stupid stuff. why? http://i.imgur.com/j1YDOqa.png https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CReiRDKUAAARYsk.png Anime man...It's just so creepy...I really can't stand looking at anime cause of their big eyes for one thing, and the way that they act as well. Since there's usually english subs, they speak japanese and that's really creepy. When I think of anime, I feel like i'm trapped in a child's playroom. Additionally, i've had nightmares about anime cause of their creepiness. But get this: It's not the horror anime that gets me, it's the bright and happy ones. I just cannot stand it. In a nutshell, if I had to quote somebody who would fit how I feel about anime the most, it would either be this: Oh, how do you watch that? It's like barfing rainbows in my eyes! Or this: Wh-I just can't understand any of this! Everybody in Japan is either a 10-year old girl or a monster. People might think of it as a stupid reason, but I say it's fair game for a hatred of anime. http://i.imgur.com/h3DcUjW.jpg hobz was the best and dont you forget it https://40.media.tumblr.com/976eb51e9bc1d93f73809ebe32c65956/tumblr_inline_nwxeayl2O61s8i73f_540.jpg <flyingdodo> yes, I regged as Ersanios man lover on the dev.smwcentral site! <flyingdodo> And snn fucked a tree!

I just want to make a confession about banned, unfortunately. I want to say sorry to all the people for Backseat Moderator, Disobey Mods, and staffs, being rude and Spread Misinformation. I just want to get this straighten out before it gets out of hand. I just want to ask users to post in help thread, so it doesn't clutter anymore. (Thanks to Mr. GreenThunder) I got banned for Backseat Mod twice then spread misinformation twice again. so, I sign up application in the Sm64 Application. But it seems like Lightvayne checked my Banned History which he wont accept unfortunately, I'll never be Sm64 moderator because of Backseat mod post counts all the time, and act stupid. I just couldn't help myself. First of all, I also want to say sorry to Alcaro and Isceptul for disrespectful. Seriously, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, because I was not having a good day. That's not you guys, it's just me badly, I think because I struggle with school. Also, I want to say sorry to K3fka for repeating the word: <removed for sanity> because I was drunk by drinking Sprite so I stop drinking it for a while. But, trust me, I'm just a great person, you know? I also apologies to everyone who seen the Thread that I was going to C suicide, that's very scary, but I'm alive. Now I'm still section banned in Sm64 Forum. You guys have to believe me. I hope you guys enjoy your thanksgiving break though. I'm happy to look forward to be nice guy in the Smwcentral. Alcaro, K3fka, Lightvayne or other users, you may reply this thread if you have anything else to say. Thank you guys for reading this! Have a good night! http://i.imgur.com/lzNIf0c.png Born-Again Brony is gonna be the name of our boy band derpy If you don't want to forward this for fear of offending someone, then YOU'RE PART OF THE PROBLEM! When will AMERICANS STOP giving away THEIR RIGHTS ??? We've gone so far the other way‚Ä¶ We've bent over backwards not to offend anyone... But it seems no one cares about the AMERICAN CITIZEN being offended! WAKE UP AMERICA!!! If You agree pass this on... If You don't agree, Just Delete It - But Shame On You!!! And shame on anyone who tries to make this a racist message... http://i.imgur.com/NdSv8FV.png?1 Thanks a bunch, all you people who decide to fucking screw me to the wide, basically framing me as a spammer, insulting me on every board I enter, and periodically fucking up my site every time I remake it. If I wasn't so bloody immature, then I might be fine. But all you do is toss and shit all over me and basically fuck me up, forever. I'm getting worse at school and it's all your bloody faults. EVERY BLOODY TIME INDEED, IT BLOODY IS. I don't like this life. All the acmlmboards I go on that StapleButter person joins it, basically pissing off the shit of me, and then some person decides to spam and say they're me. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7a/Shatterhand_cover.jpg Fine, call me a stupid idiot, but at least have some reason to other than the fact I'm doing something wrong once, got banned off about 12 boards (all being acmlmboards funny enough) and the fact I'm underage unlike everyone else here. I'm completely done with all AcmlmBoards, I'm going off somewhere else. This time I won't ever come back. Just ban and IP ban my account, put the message out about this on other boards and I'll be fine. Now I am NOT in the bloody mood as you can see, I don't feel like ever going to come back in my current state of mood, because of the way everyone treats me here and in real life. is back YEESSSS except it highlights people that might be absolutely annoying awww Thing is I expect you to ALL go and toss with this post 'oh he's loud sir' 'fucking retard for using XP' I'M FUCKING SICK TO DEATH OF IT. The only places I'll be active are sites which aren't AcmlmBoards, and I'm going off most of those too. http://i.imgur.com/pRbAMHA.jpg Hi everyone! I'm a random Italian (and half Canadian) boy who hacks games. Even if my user name is Queen Samus, you must call me Kyle, because it's my real name and I really love it! üòÉ I'm also a Bible-Believing Catholic Christian and I believe in God and His Son Jesus. I like: South Park, my girlfriend, Super Mario, Kirby, Metroid, Megaman, Terrance and Phillip, Casa Vianello, Kitchen Nightmares and Masterchef Italian Edition I hate: mother, earthbound, mother 3, racism and satanism. I REALLY HATE THE TOUHOU SERIES! DON'T INSULT ME BECAUSE OF THIS. I'm searching for some South Park fans. It's the best cartoon ever and I would like to see someone like me! Also, I REALLY LOVE Terrance and Phillip! There, I said everything. So long, I say goodbye! http://i.imgur.com/DTHAUg4.png?1 Cookie Production, LLC. Central is still in construction..

GOD BLESS THE USA!! http://i.imgur.com/5MLNQdM.jpg Waluigi is the ultimate example of the individual shaped by the signifier. Waluigi is a man seen only in mirror images; lost in a hall of mirrors he is a reflection of a reflection of a reflection. You start with Mario ‚Äì the wholesome all Italian plumbing superman, you reflect him to create Luigi ‚Äì the same thing but slightly less. You invert Mario to create Wario ‚Äì Mario turned septic and libertarian ‚Äì then you reflect the inversion in the reflection: you create a being who can only exist in reference to others. Waluigi is the true nowhere man, without the other characters he reflects, inverts and parodies he has no reason to exist. Waluigi‚Äôs identity only comes from what and who he isn‚Äôt ‚Äì without a wider frame of reference he is nothing. He is not his own man. In a world where our identities are shaped by our warped relationships to brands and commerce we are all Waluigi. https://theemptypage.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/waluigi-crouching.png?w=1280 SHUT UP, KAISSAN. You closed my thread by calling everyone wrong, and ruining everyone's fun. It was a fantasy. nobody has to explain it, it is just something to think about. No video games are real and almost nothing in them can happen. In fact, you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for a silly plumber jumping on everything to save a princess and mushroom-headed people from a massive horned turtle in a flying clown head, and all i wanted to do was think about what it would be like to be the last person on earth. I think THAT is more reasonable than mario. So i suggest that you shut up before you set someone off like this again. and instead of you complaining about how this is possible, why don't you just say: Okay, you have your fun, and i'll have mine. But no, like everyone like you on the internet, you have to not let anyone have an opinion. So maybe next time, you'll think before you post. FRIENDLY REMINDER that walking on grass is the same as physically assaulting a human being!!! üòÉ grass is a plant and therefore has life and feelings and should be treated with dignity and respect!!! üòÉ also it is an EXTREME personal and cultural slight to those who identify as grasskin or other plantkin!!! if i ever see one of you in person and you‚Äôre walking on grass you will be unfollowed blocked and deleted from the internet!!! üòÉ uwu :))) http://i.imgur.com/KURe3tH.jpg America will forever be safe from foreign invasion with that kind of home-grown firepower! Hunting... it's not just a way to fill the freezer. It's also a matter of national security. That's why all enemies, foreign and domestic, want to see us disarmed. Food for thought, when next we consider gun control. Overall it's true, so if we disregard some assumptions that hunters don't possess the same skills as soldiers, the question would still remain... What army of 2 million would want to face 30 million, 40 million, or 50 million armed citizens??? For the sake of our freedom, don't ever allow gun control or confiscation of guns. (If you agree, as I do, pass it on, I feel good that I have an army of millions who would protect our land, and I sure don't want the government taking control of the possession of firearms.) AMERICA! Designed by geniuses. Now run by idiots. I DON'T WANT TO PRODUCE A SECOND BRUTAL MARIO,OKAY????!!!! I-ONLY-WANT-TO-USE-A-FEW-RESOUCES!!!!!!!!! AAND THEESE ARE THE-MOST-INTERESTING-RESOURCES!

This should be forwarded to everyone regardless of party affiliation! We have lost 50% of our freedom of speech in the last 2 years. The news media is not allowed to print anything negative about this evil regime. http://i.imgur.com/BlVxhU6.jpg?1 <@!256056394476683265> is no different from this, she just had 10 years worth of logs to build sentences off of also i just remembered that replaced "abby" with your name in her responses yeah u dumbass Edit: DISCLAIMER: This post does NOT represent official site policy or the viewpoints of the SMW Central staff and leadership as a whole. First, leave your judgment at the door. I'm not a racist, sexist, homophobe, ableist, or hater of any other minority or subculture. Why am I saying this? Because my position on the topic of this thread is not "fashionable", and even discussing it seems to be enough to be labelled a bigot. So I feel I need to cover my bases. Already we have a problem. As for the topic, I want to talk about language and perhaps even freedom of expression. In particular, the use of words or phrases that have multiple meanings, at least one of which is discriminatory. Words like gay, faggot, rape, autist, retard, nigger, etc. that have been adapted by modern culture (particularly on the internet) to mean things that aren't hateful towards an individual or discriminatory towards a minority in certain contexts. In recent years, there has been a push against using such terms and a massive focus on being politically correct. A culture of being offended by everything and feeling the need to police others' speech with no regard for the intent of the speaker. It has grown to the point where people feel like they need watch what they say or face the risk of being labelled a hater, regardless of whether their words were intended to be hateful or not. I would like to humbly submit that SMW Central should not be a part of this. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of tiptoeing when talking about minorities. I'm tired of safe spaces. I'm tired of people being offended over nothing. People need to grow up. You can literally spend your entire life being offended if you don't learn to suck it up and get over it. We are enabling people to keep acting like children by catering to the idea that "ooh, we certainly don't want to offend anyone". this one seems to build sentences with a consistently large length also hobz spammed this to shit Obviously, I'm not saying that we should accept hate and discrimination. If you think I'm promoting that, you've missed the point. What I am saying is that we should allow people to use the language of their choice to express themselves in what manner they prefer, so long as the intent is not hateful. Obviously, if people are being malicious, it's a problem, and we need to deal with it. This obviously leaves the challenge of deciding when something is malicious and when it isn't. To that I say that we hopefully have a talented team of moderators who are good judges of intent and have a reasonable sense of justice. After all, that's why we have a moderator team and not a word filter. Malice comes in many other forms than a predetermined list of bad words. How would you like SMW Central to treat this sort of language? What kind of culture would you like to be part of? Do I have a point or am I old-fashioned? Or both? Please comment with your thoughts. And please remain civil. what have i done maybe not also we're feeding her garbage <:wildwoody3:395468905277292544> <:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553> im just waiting to hear back from

To express this aspect of my personality I draw pictures of myself as an anthropomorphic 1978 Honda Civic and share them with others of my kind. My girlfriend is an 1975 AMC Gremlin, and we are soul-mates. Automobile soul-mates. I communicate with others of my kind mostly through the internet, but sometimes we attend conventions. People persecute us for our true selves. My neighbor threatened to call the cops on me just for talking to his Escort. I'm not even into Fords, but that's besides the point. Just because I AM a car doesn't mean I'm going to have relations with just every car I see. It's not about the sex, though there is a 1955 Chevy Bel-Air I will never forget. You never forget your first. But I'm sick of people saying I'm perverted and wrong, and that I'm not really a car I'm just crazy. They don't understand, I have just as much right to the road as they do. Those assholes at the DMV are the worst, but I'd rather not talk about that ugly incident of carsecution. I have a good mechanic, though. You've never lived until you've had this guy change your oil. It doesn't make me gay, because I'm a Honda, not really a person. Your morality doesn't apply to me. I am a car. Beep beep, mother fucker.

She immediately said, "You know you could live with us forever.." I gave her a confused look and she continued, "We understand that you live on earth and you REALLY wish to live here". I then said "How..How did you know?" She then giggled and said "Because we've been watching you, silly!" This was a dream come true and I almost cried right there. She then said, "I talked with Headmaster Cid and he agreed that you would be PERFECT for SeeD, you just have to do...one thing".

She immediately said, "You know you could live with us forever.." I gave her a confused look and she continued, "We understand that you live on earth and you REALLY wish to live here". I then said "How..How did you know?" She then giggled and said "Because we've been watching you, silly!" This was a dream come true and I almost cried right there. She then said, "I talked with Headmaster Cid and he agreed that you would be PERFECT for SeeD, you just have to do...one thing". She then held my hand and looked deep into my eyes and said "...You have to kill yourself for the transfer to work correctly." I then gave her some questions, "How long do I have before the deal expires?" She then said "Cid said 3 months.." I added by saying "What's the most painless way?..." She giggled again, "Suicide will require pain buuut...if you want it quick...Get a gun and a nice shot to the head works. I then agreed and she gave me a kiss on the forehead, "I know this will be tough but once it's over and done, you'll get to live here!" I then woke up and this was last week and i purchased a gun. I might actually kill myself because that dream just felt too real to be fake and my life isn't doing so grand. http://revistaw.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/navegar.gif

I believe my true self is that of a 1978 Honda Civic. That is who I truly am on the inside, my soul-being. To express this aspect of my personality I draw pictures of myself as an anthropomorphic 1978 Honda Civic and share them with others of my kind. My girlfriend is an 1975 AMC Gremlin, and we are soul-mates. Automobile soul-mates. I communicate with others of my kind mostly through the internet, but sometimes we attend conventions. People persecute us for our true selves. My neighbor threatened to call the cops on me just for talking to his Escort. I'm not even into Fords, but that's besides the point. Just because I AM a car doesn't mean I'm going to have relations with just every car I see. It's not about the sex, though there is a 1955 Chevy Bel-Air I will never forget. You never forget your first. But I'm sick of people saying I'm perverted and wrong, and that I'm not really a car I'm just crazy. They don't understand, I have just as much right to the road as they do. Those assholes at the DMV are the worst, but I'd rather not talk about that ugly incident of carsecution. I have a good mechanic, though. You've never lived until you've had this guy change your oil. It doesn't make me gay, because I'm a Honda, not really a person. Your morality doesn't apply to me. I am a car. Beep beep, mother fucker. Deal with it. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71663893/fdlrgoh.jpg

holy shit you guys already reduced the bots output to literally only mangled copy pasta
The year is 2129; humans can only communicate through increasingly garbled copy-pasta. A man approaches and says "ire: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà 10 ÔΩìÔΩîÔΩíÔΩèÔΩãÔΩÖ ÔΩÑÔΩâÔΩÉÔΩã ff ‚òë EKT ‚òæ ‚òÜ ¬∏. ?"

ATTENTION, OCTAVIAN MOROSAN! This is Captain Cucumber of the Vegan Police! You have been accused of violating the Supreme Vegan Charter by drafting beast cards in your arena decks and forcing them to fight for you! This is a blatant act of animal exploitation and is punishable by death! Surrender peacefully and we will make it a quick and painless one! This is your only warning!
Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.
My dad beats me FeelsBadMan My mom beats me FeelsBadMan My brother beats me FeelsBadMan My sister beats me FeelsBadMan At least I feel safe with Kripp, because he can't beat anyone FeelsGoodMan
i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about reynad. u wouldnt say this shit to him at lan, hes jacked. not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol.
Sugar! PJSugar Spice! PJSalt And everything nice! OhMyDog CoolCat KappaPride These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect streamer. But Professor Reynad accidentally added an extra ingredient to the concoction - Chemical Vegan! Thus, the Kripp was born! BabyRage
I cannot get over how much this guy complains as soon as he doesn't get extremely lucky. He is so incredibly narcissistic that he truly believes nobody else is allowed to do well or draft effective cards. We are all just guests who play in Kripp's world of hearthstone. To suggest that you are better than Kripp must simply mean that you have better RNG. What an arrogant failure of a man
Hola, Kripp, this is Antonio, Rania's secret Puerto Rican lover. I mistakenly left a package of my Magnum XXL Heavy-Duty Condoms at your place last night while you were complaining about a children's card game. I was hoping I could swing by tonight and pick them up. I'll just go in through the backdoor just like how I do with Rania, the dirty girl! Thanks, and good luck with your funny little computer game!

"Your deck is insane." Trump said, as he slipped his feminine hand into Kripp's pants and smirked. "Are you trying to top-deck me?" protests Kripp, as Trump blushes, the boyish figure undressed before Kripp. "Weak tempo play, Trump." The two kissed, deeply and passionately, and afterwards Trump places his Leper Gnome into Kripp's Twisting Nether.

When Kripp is eat I pretend he is eat me. I go down Kripp wet Kripp throat and am in warm Kripp stomach. Then I go deeper into the Kripp. I am made into Kripp gold. The Kripp sits on toilet and frees me. I am sad I am no longer Kripp food. Then Kripp eats me again.
Hey Kripp! So here I was enjoying my favorite food (pizza) and watching your stream having a good time when it started to taste extra salty. It turns out you were being super salty and now have ruined my pizza. Are you going to pay for another pizza or will I have to call the cops? This is serious.
"YOU KNOW I DON'T DO ANAL", squeals Reynad as he scurried away, but it doesn't matter. "Get your ass back her!" roars Forsen as he grabs Reynad's flaccid donger and pulls him back. Forsen penetrates Reynad with his Iron Juggernaut. Moments later the mine explodes, dealing 10 damage to Reynad's rectal cavity. "Hmmm, well played" whispers Forsen in Reynads ear as he takes the lethal.

leod is abby gonna make more sense over time or stay dumb like this
if you keep pissing in her logs she will forever be stupid but yes more logs means more variety
"to create inversion in Wario ‚Äì reflect the Mario"
deep.....
ok well atleast the copy pastas im posting
are valid english
so it should improve her english, right?
sure
i mean markov chains dont go for valid english they just go for "this word often comes after this word"
do they only look at the very next word
ive set it to order 2 so it looks at the last 2 words
setting it to order 1 could make her less likely to repeat full sentences
so when I say "the big"
abby will say "the big cum"
<:OMEGAZULIDLUL:374208601167757324>
if she wanted to say the big then cum would be likely yeah
same @üò≥ euuna üò°
big cum
big cum
heres a thing though
i could make her store logs line by line
so she realizes sentence stops
should i do that
so now she thinks
rn she just dumps it all into one single line
so everything is one sentence
stops should be followed by should?
yea

abby give me the succ
derpy ruined the bot
oh actually i already switched it to single lines
can you lock it to only valid english words
i forgot i did that to test
so rn half her logs for this server are one line and then everything else is another
also yea if you give me an entire dictonary in javascript array or json form
im sure you can get that on googlies
thing is she would not be able to tell apart english words and nicknames or memes
tru
or typos
can you go in her logs and edit out all of derpys garbage
yea
babby
heres her brain
go and edit out the garbo üëè
itsa text file
I mean
if we stop spamming shit copy pasta
tthen the copy pasta data will eventually be drowned out by conversation
itll just fade out and become less and less likely yea
so the obvious solution is to ban derpy
cx

abby
does she always use the person who triggereed her name
abby
abby stop reading that channel its corrupting you
lol
abby mangle my pasta more
abby kripp
fucking stop with the waluigi pasta abby
medic she doesnt always use your name but she does what the original did
replaces all instances of "abby" in her logs with your name
so abby either does üò≥ or waluigi
if she tried to say flabby she would say fleuuna
ohhh right
the plabby
tfw broken html abby
ok once it hits the pleb test its kinda stuck on it lol
abby
abby babby
(the first one takes a while because she has to load in the whole data file)
o
I mean the file is still relatively small
ifif you leave her for a few months its gonna take ages
its streamed in chunk by chunk so my memory doesnt die once its gigantic
so it takes a part of the words?
no it takes all of them but it only reads them part by part, meaning the delay is a bit longer
in exchange for not needing to load a 5 gigabyte file into memory
but that means the delay will get longer and longer as the file gets bigger
yea
its only the first time
after coming online
how are the times after faster if its not loading shit into memory then
or is it loading processed data
then
its loading processed data then
abby gay
when first loading in the file it constructs the probablity of a word appearing after another word
for every single word
once its loaded in it just checks
a b c d e f g
abby has the big gay
lol
theyre putting chemicals in the soy thats turning the beef gay abby
does it do anything with your input
look
she shows typing status now
MD
üòÑ
wtf
<:OMEGAZULIDLUL:374208601167757324>
why did it just say shes typing...
oh
LIDL bot
she types every single time anyone is sending a message LUL
even if she decides that she doesnt want to respond
you put it to whenever shes processing shes typing
WeSmart
fix her <:babyrage:331895804115812352>
i should just attach this to the callCommand function instead of the message handler cx
then she'll do it from time commands too
i am smrt
smh
why did that one not work?
but zulul did?
is that like a twitch sub thing?
it is
also you have to use actual emote codes
yu can copy paste someone else's
idk them <:4HEad:385555914675191811>
abby typing up a storm
lol
the typing status stays for a few seconds after turning off typing btw (for real people too) so thats why she keeps doing it
fucking SmithJrBlaquaLuigi
actually the biggest retard ive ever seen
hey hesn ice
being nice and being retarded arent mutually exclusive
leod
make a yugioh channel we can post our big cums in
anyone can make a channel?=
so abby starts talking about needlefiber
lol
:lul
needlefiber into glow up
look
she does take what you say into account üòÑ
that was clear proof
this was the first time anyone said needlefiber and she responded to it instantly
jasmine into glowup into summon sorc into 2 sagequoia into galaxy tomahawk into troymare extra link CX
firewall eff bounce summon
if we just keep saying into with combos then abby will come up with her own yugioh combos
like firewall pass
lol
<:gygoFirewall:435787418034241537>
goblin into gouki into satellar into predap orphys
abby goblin
goblin abby
ive seen troymare unicorn pass
lol
powerful play
abby
ok the typing works right now
abby crystron needlefiber
it lingers though
lmao
it is not march 1st
oh right she just takes current year if you dont set one
its after march 1st
so she says it
yea
the way i coded that is the bunglest fuck
what she actually sees is "march 1st [current year]"
if you tell her march 1st 2019 she sees "march 1st 2019 2018"
and it works LOL
wow
morbid
she also says that for 4 years
cx
thats just rude
3 years is max
excuse me
tfw
3 years from now 2018
?? ?
B R O K E N

I DONT UNDERSTAND
your bot sucks
the big dick
abby what are you doing
can you not just give her every message said in this guild ever
did you send a DM
i got an error related to guilds
which only happens when someone dms a message cause i havent fixed that still
uea I dm
crystron needlefiber
there it works in dms now
you can use m!do say ass in 3 seconds and she will remind you
t.g. wonder magician

chimerafflesia into ultra poly revive into jasmine into glow up into summon sorc revive glow up summon sorc eff into spore into linkuriboh into firewall into needlefiber into jet synchron
grass is greener into gg
if you dont mill snow grass isnt THAT great
jet synchron into revive linkuriboh eff pitch 1 for jet synchron into the big cum
you mill either snow or 500 infernoids and win
jet synchron is just lidl glow up bulb
yea but glow up was already used in that combo
spore
why not spore
used it too!
if you use jasmine to grab glow up
you can make summon sorc out of the two
then revive glow up and get spore
then make linkuriboh out of spore and summon needle (or just summon needle if you dont want linkuriboh in gy)
then u can still revive spore + use the jet synchron summon + the summon sorc + the revive of the synchron to make like, firewall and a something!
<:OMEGAZULIDLUL:374208601167757324>
wow
and then you have a bunch of vanillas

unbattleable vanillas and a firewall!
okay i have to make a help command now that theres actually commands
üòî
make a yugioh card text command
Pag
what would it do
you give it a card name
and it gives the stats and text
where do i get the stats and text from
ygopro database
is there a link to an always up to date copy of that
dunno
or you could scrape a wiki or smth idk
but the cards.cdb has everything
you just use a sqlite js framework and use search sql and itll be efficient
node very probably comes with one since its designed to host websites
thats probably sql server
sqlite is different
it really doesnt amtter its just a matter of npm install sqlite and its there
https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite
üëè
ok and be sure to check for anime cards
still havent found a canonical cdb link
https://github.com/Ygoproco/Live2017Links this has a ton but
which one is the right one
just use the cards.cdb ygopro gives you?
im not going to make the bot download the entire ygopro package every time it boots
or
https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/
an sqlite database is preferrable to asking a website
this is good to knoiw that it exists tho lmao
thats official
means it wont have any pre release cards
tru
cant you just point abby to the ygopro db on your disk
i can but then it will never ever update
unless you mean the one in my actual ygopro folder in which case no i dont want the bot to depend on anything specific to my pc
then shrug
maybe the site has an api
https://www.ygohub.com/api/all_cards
we did it
random ass other website to the rescue
pag
i cannot figure out how to use this LOL
also
https://www.ygohub.com/api/card_info?name=blue_eyes_white_dragon
thanks for the error
give me a simple card name im blanking
Raigeki
https://www.ygohub.com/api/card_info?name=raigeki
pag
image and all
can it do one of those fancy things
where it puts it in like a formatted box
with image and shit
idk how tf that works
i can do that yea ill just have to learn how
theyre called embeds ive seen some stuff for them in the api
tfw missed the big boy highlight
and let me call it with like [card] or smth
abby tabb
ü§î
leod whys it typing
because discord is bad at updating that
its going on for a while tho
just only put "is typing" if its thinking
<@!150802630677889025> https://youtu.be/CDV2WoN-tVE
abby typing up a hurricane
thats what its doing
no I mean if I just type abby and it insta responds theres no need
only do it if its the first time and it has to take a while
now its just doing it out of nowhere
then id have to specifically tell it to type on specific commands and thats annoying
yea it is tho wtf

Abby bobcat goldthwait
ruined
make her use everything as one again tbh
loading in namelss' bio was cheating btw
why
because now all its wacky phrases are from somebody else not organically learned through watching out chat
its like feeding jokes into a comedians ear and then letting them take the credit when the audience laughs
i added my old bio to you know
no leod removed that
cause it had a shitload of broken html
>pendulum chaos summon
amaze
<:kermit:394547357351542784>
its searchable by sky iris/revolution drago ntoo
cause its a dragon pendulum

abby üñï
yea but you can just
abby
place it in pendulum
abby

get your search

I'll add my grandpas racist emails
but if you use both effs its a +1
its nuke is probably a bit too balanced lol
but its untargetted sending
which is Good
only unaffected ignores that
no the old bio is still there
i just removed broken html
why does abby seemingly favour those bios tho
every time it posts a lot its almost always just a verbatim chunk of the bio
because theyre big with a lot of words
i see
wht about all my big with a lot of words

even while loading
it defers all markov commands to once the markov is ready and loaded if it isnt yet
<:ilikethesoundofthat:346754449496211469>

what's the point of Abby if hobz is just gonna ruin it
derpy is crabby <:wildwoody5:376939786876747776>
also im not the one that loaded it up with links to videos and pictures u fool
that's better than spamming the same thing over and over like a 2 year old
whats more intrusive a wall of abby or a fuckn massive image that isnt funny because theres no context
its not spam
its machine learning üòí
<:kermitthinks:394548147382255618>
do u think u teach a dog its name by handing it pictures of the wizard of oz's credit screen because LOL IT SAYS MIDGETS X(
no u say its name until it gets a feel for whats going on
i am a smart man and i get machines
also you cant complain about me feeding it profiles and that it won't learn squad naturally did you just highlight it 8 million times
give abby the big nut X(
i thought it didnt learn through highlights
it keeps saying things we didnt highligt it before saying
it does
i didnt highlight it for any of the profiles
ya thats what i mean
highlighting it just lets it leave its chamber and grace us iwth its words of wisdom
abby
you see its fine
<:kermitthinks:394548147382255618>
no it's not because I'm gonna have to block Abby if this is all its gonna say
tfw blocking abby üòî
<@102843234706804736> why does abby so obsessed with jim sterling andsterling
did we not literally only say his name once
or did somebody load it up yesterday
i dont know, machines are a wonder
it's because its the first thing Abby heard
there might be some wild association between tim, youtube, sterling and flushed
so it got to repeat it over and over
that it found

whats the name of the singing frog
michigan j frog
derpy did the singing frog cartoon win an award
i dont think so
i hope it did
not an oscar anyway
its in the national film registry <:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>
Filmmaker Steven Spielberg, in the PBS Chuck Jones biographical documentary Extremes & Inbetweens: A Life in Animation, called One Froggy Evening "the Citizen Kane of animated shorts". In 1994, it was voted #5 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field. In 2003, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant", and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.
but yea not even an oscar nom
i dont think whats opera doc got an oscar nom either
i would call one froggy evening the perfect cartoon tbh
add that to wikipedia
when im famous
probably not but i agree with you
derpy tbh lets become cartoon historians at some arts school
<:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>
id do it
we can study the cultural significance of cartoons and trace back cultural shifts and evolutions to the cartoons they produced

wheres jerry beck work
i want to watch ren and stimpy with a class of university students and discuss the cultural factors that led to the show's inception
youre gonna have to talk about how john k is a no-good bad man tho
well i guess for me im more interested in the science behind *why* certain jokes work
so it'd be watching a ren and stimpy episode and breaking down the factors that make the show's humour work despite a clear goal or punchline
also ya
i just want to study comedy at a professional level
<:considerthis:382183258865270787> remember class, don't date and sexually groom your underage fans
i think thats my actual dream job since directing and acting feel like more of a pipe dream
just getting to analyze comedy and break down the hows and whys is what i want to do
because for me the true humour comes from the cold calculated classroom environment stripping any sort of humour or joy from the actual subject mattert
like breaking down humour in a way that makes it not funny while also celebrating it)
my dream job is hosting my own podcast/talk show and making a living to all the hack fraud youtubers and b-list stars that i love

my mind was blown when i realized that hot shots part deux was a rambo spoof
i thought it was its own movie all this time
but no theres a movie called first blood and its basically the plot of hot shots
<:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>
i think i remember you telling me about this
also that reminds me when i was watching some simpsons eps and i watched 'a star is burns'
and there were like five different moments where i went "oh yeah its that meme"
same as watching spongebob <:dolbob:427651794492194827>
ya
also i watched the 22 shorts about springfield ep <:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>
(dont watch that one again until after you watch pulp fiction btw)

you could make all troymares
also lmao @ all the 90 year old republicans jumping on kanye's dick now
While this card is in the graveyard: Target 1 Link-3 or higher monster you control, reduce its Link Rating by 1, then special summon this card to a zone that monster points to. After this card leaves the field: The zone this monster was in cannot be used until your next End Phase.
pog
that would be cute
zone eater
sorry cant do it
already taken
5
5h
5th turn
ok explain this card to me
too new
wtf
thats a tcg card
whatever
Cannot be Normal or Special Summoned if you control a monster. Neither player can activate a monster effect unless the number of monster effects that player has previously activated that turn is less than the number of monster card types currently on the field (Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum, and Link). (If an effect‚Äôs activation was negated, it still counts toward the total for that turn. Only count effects that were activated while this monster was face-up on the field.)
you cant activate monster effects
if you have an xyz, you can activate 1 monster effect a turn
if yo uhave an xyz and a fusion, 2
etc
ok so its lidl amano iwato
yea but its 2k and sticks
its played in true draco
because they get extra normals out the ass and it blocks hand traps
so they ns that, do their plays and then tribute it for master peace

i asked my regional manager if i can come in on friday (my day off) to work for a few hours to make up for calling in sick on monday
he said no
and he said that my only option would be to work overtime on another day
aka this dickhead unironically suggested that if i want to make up my 7.5 hours, i just work a 17 1/2 hour work day
<:concerned:368837468528705536>
so im debating doing it so i can die and then get him in trouble
what happens if you dont do it
other than not getting the money
i lost like 90$pay

(that was me dying)
i feel like i talk about death too much and its getting to be a little stale but this is like an actual possibility
youre not actually gonna do a 17-hour day are you
how can somebody in a position like regional manager prohibit somebody from coming in on a day off but think this is a good alternative
idk probably not
by the time you hit hour ten you already feel like youre gonna die
plus there's literally nothing to do, is the other thing
so i could do my computer training but >slept for 1 hour > worked for 10 hours > through the night >sits at a computer > learnign about plumbing
<:concerned:368837468528705536>
mama mia
its a crummy situation and rn i cant really afford to lose that money (jk i can i just dont want to <:considerthis:382183258865270787> )
can you talk to one of his superiors about it
this guy the actual most superior i can talk to
hes the manager for the entire region
damn
thats why some small part of me is like " <:ilikethesoundofthat:346754449496211469> if i do this guys fuckn 17 hour work day and something bad happens and i tell him i was told it was the only way i'd get paid for my sick day..."
by telling him i mean tell the paramedics and by extension the store managers
you could prolly do that without doing the 17 hour work day
"i just wanted to come in.... on a friday.... "

tfw they got the beach boys to do a song two episodes into the show's existence
tho i guess they werent doing anything else by 1999
i honestly dont know where the tf stephen hilenberg made all of his <:wildwoody2:368845220487364628> musical friends
he got the artic monkeys at like the height of their fame
and for those of us in NA, they were basically as big as the beatles
he got ween and thats all that really matters tbh
he got ween a few times ya
also johnny depp lol

hey david bowie shall you serenade us with a <:wildwoody5:376939786876747776>

its prolly for the best they didnt have him sing all the songs they wrote for that ep were fucking terrible
thats definitely why he didnt
i always thought it was supposed to be a meta joke or something
its a musical episode - starring david bowie <:considerthis:382183258865270787>
wow what does he sing <:wildwoody5:376939786876747776>

every time @ mr krabs voice
theres also this https://youtu.be/iEhRcOEqlCU
that ones good too
iirc it has an actual like 3 1/2 minute song on the show soundtrack
ya
the song where mr krabs is on the exercise bike u hear for 5 seconds is a full song
ya
https://youtu.be/mHBHHEoJ_WA
well that one is a stock song iirc
o
oh ya derpy i accidentally overlooked it but
reminder pantera did the hibernation day theme
every time
thats prooooooobably peak spongebob soundtrack
https://youtu.be/7VrKThu9zYk
me
i wish i could flashback to the day that episode came out and see the face of every adult that saw the credit "featuring the song Hibernation Theme by Pantera" and capture their 'what the hell' face
and bottle and sell them
did they ever get a lou reed song
https://youtu.be/cS4Gs6NFbKg

<:kermitthinks:394548147382255618>
oya derpy the freeform jazz track
is a stock track üòî
if they actually recorded it for the show i'd nut
spongebob background tracks are great too tbh
https://youtu.be/xi_lFjhDRQo?list=PLDCF162D5581F9725
yeah
i sitll get
actually mad
when i think about the episode where squidward becomes nice and it pisses spongebob off
i hate that episode so much and idk why it doesnt top peoples lists for worst spongebob episode
wait which one is that
the entire plot is literally spongebob hates squidward because hes nice
and it ends with spongebob trying to kill squidward
because hes sick of squidward being nicer then him
the whole episode is him trying to piss squidward off because for some reason its really pissing him off that people like squidward now
as a kid that episode made me furious
http://spongebob.wikia.com/wiki/Breath_of_Fresh_Squidward
yeah that
oh yeah no its that spongebob yells at squidward and tlels him that nobody likes him and that he needs to leave
and then squidward cries and leaves
and its like what the fuck is this a moral
<:concerned:368837468528705536>
no this was when the show went full "fuck you squidward" mode
remember the pizza ep where squidward stands up for spongebob after the guy yelled at him for not bringing his DRINK
that would never happen in the post-movie seasons
Squidward returns to the kitchen, even making a fresh batch of Krabby Patties, but SpongeBob arrogantly rejects them, calling them "no good.
good job
joke
i get the idea is like jealousy consuming spongebob but when has he ever shown any signs of jealousy
tbh theres a lot of season 1 moments that have some more subtle character stuff like that
and it makes it sound like spongebob's only nice for attention, which is the worst part
that imo got kinda lost even in the later good seasons
like sandy being from texas
if you look carefully youll learn that sandy is from texas
<:ilikethesoundofthat:346754449496211469>
<:wildwoody2:368845220487364628>
or the fact that mr krabs loves money
its sublte, but its always there
remember when sandy built a rocket once and her science was never brought up again in seasons 1-3
and then after that the writers decided <:kermitthinks:394548147382255618> her character is a scientist now
what am i complaining about anymore
idk
remember when sandy built a rocket
for no particular reason
she just felt like it
thats a good character
im only saying all this because they changed patrick's eyebrows between season 1 and 2
and this has not settled with me
my favourite part of spongebob is that they made a drop the soap joke
i tell every single person i meet about that
and then we all burst into laughter and i pull up the screencap from funnyjunk.com
ü§£ üòÇ HOW DID THEY GET AWAY WITH THAT ONE?!?!
i think the only spongebob ep that made me Mad was "Gone"
where everybody left spongebob to celebrate "Fuck You Spongebob" day
because i guess everybody hates spongebob now
remember kids if none of your friends or family are around its because theyre away celebrating how much they hate you
whats that one youtube cannel that does all the "bad spongebob videos"
because he ALWAYS blames mr lawrence because bill lawrence works on all the worst episodes
animated atrocities?
but he also overlooks bill lawrence worked on most of the shows best episode too and i want to pull him aside and tell him this
maybe
also FUCK that mr lawrence is king
he voices plankton aka the best character
its like the top 12 worst spongebob episodes guy
thats probably animated atrocities
he has an editing quirk i really like idk if ive seen before where every number is backed by a clip from the show and as it counts down the clip shows more and more
until for #1 you see the whole thing
(so its the same clip 12 times but its usually funny enough that it works every time)
also mr lawrence did the "my leg" line
and worked with hillenberg on rocko's modern life and camp lazlo
HOBZ
he wrote for that 90s felix the cat cartoon <:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>

<@102843234706804736> NEW GENERIC R4
Number 27: Dreadnought Battleship Dreadnoid Rank 4 WATER Machine Xyz Effect Monster 2200 ATK / 1000 DEF 2+ Level 4 monsters -You can only use this card name's (1) effect once per turn. (1) At the end of the Battle Phase, if this card destroyed an opponent's monster by battle: You can Special Summon from your Extra Deck, 1 Rank 10 or higher Machine Xyz Monster by using this face-up card you control as material. (This is treated as an Xyz Summon. Transfer its materials to the Summoned monster.)<Trigger> (2) If this face-up card on the field would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can detach 1 material from this card instead.<Continuous>
this is really good if you get it off
cause you can make the super quantal beast xyz who shuffles during eithe rplayers turn
dreadnaught battleship dreadnoid is a scuffed name
that is really sick lmao
its a translation
=.=
theyll make free RUM xyzes at some point im sure cause
theyre way too much effort to be worth it in any way, all of them
na itll be a link
üò°
itll just be
a rum you can use from gy
or rather
you can use a xyz in gy
so you can link your stuff away
and then rum it
maybe!

<@102843234706804736> does abby write her message and then not send it until someone says her name
no
then why do i see "abby is typing" after every time she says something
or almost every time
because it takes bots a few seconds to stop typing
o
its like
you know how whe na human types
and they dont type for a bit it stops saying they type
but the input bar still has their stuff there
it does that for bots, but it doesnt automatically cancel the typing when a bot sends a message
which it does for humans
o

(the best part of this is the top thread where'st elcid says "dang i knew it'd be bad" and then somebody that isnt a dickhead chimes in like "actually it isnt bad" and elcid is like "wh-..... oh okay"

lmao the spectator disconnected
<@234428822055944192> o ya i forgot about this song. it was cool tho. shame the adult swim DOOM thing got cut short
a bit of a lazy sample flip but it works
yeah
ive been listening to a lot of hip hop lately
i made a 18 hour long hip hop playlist lol
on Spotify
original song is not that good tho lmao kinda standard metalcore
man im kinda considering migrating to spotify at this point cuz im getting irritated with google play glitches that are never gonna be addressed. its prolly not worth it tho cuz im still paying earlybird prices for google
ive been out of hiphop lately tbh been flipfloping between jazz and metal in a really weird way mostly
tho theres a couple recentish hip-hop releases that have been in my rotation. new saba is good to vibe to but a bit long and samey. and the jean grae/quelle chris collab album is great
been listening to the new evidence a lot
new skyzoo is worth checking out
damn i missed those releases somehow lol. i havent been following that side of stuff enough
f.yt evidence what i need
oh yeah furbot died in this channel
still gotta give prhyme 2 and the doom/czarface collab another listen
f.yt evidence what i need
good song
tho i did not like prhyme 2 very much on first listen
yeah i gotta give that doom / czarface album a listen
its not prime DOOM tbh but its better than he has been i guess
f.yt skyzoo the stick-up tape from menace
its less phoned in than i expected but still a bit phoned in
ok
yeah mf doom is kinda
h
oh yeah i listened to atrocity exhibition yesterday for the first time
i really like it tho its definitely more for the sound than the lyrics
it was a good album, the thing most interesting abt it were the instrumentals though
completely abstracted from a lot of other hip hop ive been hearing lol
ya. paul white fucking killed it
and the few tracks he didnt do blended in well enough
i actually decided to chedck the album out cos i was listening to spotify radio n aint it funny came up and i was like
what the fuck is this
there's an EP with some leftovers
in a really good way
lmao aint it funny is wild
get hi was not a song i enjoyed though
lol i kinda get it but yeah its probably the worst one
only song on the album i didnt like at all
im running into some stuff i wanna add to my playlist but spotify doesnt have it so its h
id love on doing an evil deed blues but that ugly isnt on it
nor is any of the shawn kemp instrumental shit
o ya u still cant upload shit to spotify right
i will probably stick to google then
no, you cant. you can listen to your own local music through spotify on computers i believe
but dont think theres anything like that for phones
also god my playlist made me realize how many kanye songs i like and how bad i feel about that esp in the current wake of kanye
im getting a new phone with a really good dac so i might switch to using more local stuff cuz high quality formats
yeah i mean i like kanye as a musician but as a person hes pretty fucked
still gotta listen to the latest update of life of pablo lol cuz people swear its significantly better
https://puu.sh/Ac5WM/e5a44f1462.png yeah you can do this
i dont think you can add that stuff to playlists or anything cos it just streams it off ur computer rather than the service. ill have to look into it
the life of pablo is okay
best thing about the latest update is saint pablo is on it
google play is sometimes bad at matching uploads to its library tho so sometimes you get duplicates.
and that track goes the fuck off
if its a slightly different mix or something
yeah that bangs
honestly i mostly just wanna add a few ugly mane things, some instrumentals, and some stuff from the first cities aviv album which isnt on spotify
oh yeah and also the second deltron 3030 album cos i liked a few tracks from that
man i forgot about cities aviv its been a while
which also isnt on spotify for some reason
he has a new album out but i havent listened to it yet
god theres a new kanye single
i havent been keeping up with mixtape releases like i used to either. tho i think these days mixtape usually means "album thats only on streaming", we're kinda past the brief period where people were putting out album quality stuff as free downloads
didnt kanye announce like 3 albums this year or something lol
a cudi collab, turbografx-16 (still a terrible album name) and maybe something else?
err wait the third was King Push finally coming out (hype!)
kanye has an album coming out june first
its probably gonna be not great
and also probably not even an album
probably yeah
its like 7 songs
looks like itll be a glorified ep
going the weeknd route
im optimistic for King Push tho even if its been pushed back forever
man people were gassing that weeknd ep lol
"the old weeknd is back!" but nope
i went back to the king push prelude recently and i forgot how good it is tbh. pusha is one dimensional as fuck but he makes it sound so good
prelude...
god that just reminds me of how like
i wish lil ugly manes panopticon existed
prelude to panopticon
aka on doing an evil deed blues... so good. good soung
sound
oya i still have to listen to that new panopticon album lol
but yeah on doing an evil deed blues is crazy
think i like it more than uneven compromise tbh
the instrumental is just.... So Good
probably my fav hip hop instrumental
third side of tape might still be my fav ugly mane project overall actually hes fucking great as a producer
and i love the throw everything at the wall type approach
i wonder if hes still working on that mista thug isolation sequel
oblivion access is so good though it grew on me
i need to go back to it a bit more. there was a period where it grew on me but then i got a little tired of it idk. i felt some of the production was a little abrasive just for the sake of it i guess
the production is like
Sewer Rap
and some of the lyrics came off a little corny
theres some great songs tho for sure
drain counter is my fav ugly mane song off an album
i also really liked the alt-instrumental version of opposite lanes more than the original
i really like intent up until it devolves into him screaming into a vibrato effect lol
god i really liked that actually
that love the lyrics on that track
the sample at the end is weird
a weird thing i noticed is the first two actual tracks both have the same thing where they fade out and then the instrumental comes back for another like two-three loops
yeah the lyrics are great and idk im a sucker for beats with basslines like that
leonards lake is a great instrumental track also
slow eerie upright bass type stuff
weakest moments on the album for me are the first half of collapse and appear (the second half is one of the best moments on the album by far), slugs (idk i just didnt jive with the track as much as others) and compliance feels unnecessary
the other noise interlude
i kinda remember liking slugs but i think it was mostly the beat
god the first time i heard collapse and appear i didnt know what to think
think it fits the meaning of the track a lot though
been listening to mista thug isolation a bit and gettin gmore into it
yeah i still really like it. i think it does a good job of taking like, the classic memphis rap template and taking it into more extreme and interesting territory
even the cover's a really tripped out tribute to shitty 90s rap cover art
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzeqEDd0lg some of the 90s memphis underground shit was pretty ahead of its time tho this tape is like borderline cloud rap
first final went ok
I'm prolly gonna die at the next one tho

I'm still contemplating whether to go out drinking tonight or start packing cuz I leave tomorrow morning
i forgot most schools go later than mine cuz they dont do a full summer term. is this yr last term?
yeah
then i need to find a job
depends when you have to leave tbh. i kinda found that less people were going out drinking end of term than i thought, i think people were more trying to just get out and the crazier partying will happen around grad
I'm gonna find out if I get one more followup interview in grand rapids and I've got some oral exam interviews in Philly for some government jobs
this would be the third time I've gone to the bar this week
man im not sure if im gonna regret deciding to go to grad school lol. tho i guess if i hate it i can opt out early on?
I'm not doing grad school
most accounting jobs dont need you to have an mba
moving to fucking vancouver kinda scares me
i mean im pretty sure ill be fine and make new friends but i havent been like, completely without somebody i know when moving to a new place before. i dormed with a high school friend in first year.
i already had that moment when going to college so I don't think it'd bother me as much
plus if i work with the Philly government theres people i know in there
i prolly have some acquaintances or friends of friends out there and idk ive been chatting with my classmates
most of my classmates are coming over from india tho it seems lol so they won't be able to show me around the city and stuff

my favourite kind of movie franchise is one that isolates anybody that doesnt give it enough money
oh apparently hawkeye isnt in the movie at all and it isnt acknowledged
hes just not there but he also isnt dead
is it because the actor wanted more money
idk i didnt look it up because i didnt give a shit
also idk what side of the fence ur on with this review i assumed we'd all agree with the reviewer but the comments are mad at them
i mean i got it from https://twitter.com/9_volt88/status/990278730319843328
no theyre baffled by the idea of a movie billed as a standalone feature expecting you to have a decade's worth of knowledge of its source material and characters
thats on the reviewer for not understanding how this stuff works but im also not going to call them wrong for it
is it really billed as a standalone feature tho
a lot of people in the loop are seemingly unaware that the phrase "oh my god if you didnt watch captain america winter soldier how do you expect to keep up with the avengers franchise"
"if you didnt see Thor: The Dark Moon just stay home dont even bother going to see the avengers
"LOL YOU DIDNT SEE IRON MAN 2 YET YOU THINK YOU CAN WATCH THOR RAGNAROK"
thats how i want to see movies
and yes it is, to people that arent keeping up with the series
from the outside the marvel movies just look like a bunch of standalone movies and franchises of smaller characters because thats how its billed
Iron Man 1-3 is an entirely different series to Thor 1-3, they just exist in the same universe
well i guess i could see people getting confused by something like captain america: civil war
since thats an avengers movie presented as a captain america movie
at least from what i can tell
yeah for seemingly no reason at all
theyre just shamelessly gate-keeping anybody that isnt a diehard fan which i think is a bad way to operate but its also working for them
but hobz we need all the major avengers (except hulk) to have a third movie for season 3
or phase 3
w/e its called
i mean it works because a billion people are in the loop
its a skeevy marketing tactic that maybe im just being too <:impetus:397545192296808448>
but if you force your fanbase to see every single movie you make because they *need* that context or theyll be left behind,
like what choice has a marvel fan had for the last 3 years
either watch every single movie so they can enjoy infinity war
or miss one and potentially miss a big moment
or that context thats apparently completely absent from the movie
tfw ur forced to go see antman to know all the specifics
yeah
so i think the new yorker review could've had a valid argument and a good stake in the sand regarding all this stuff but it went too far into "old man yells at cloud" territory so its getting blasted
it shouldve been an open conversation regarding the concept of a gate-keeping cinematic universe that is only welcome to the people willing to put in the time and effort (and money <:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553> ) to keep up fully
and whether thats really what the antithesis of pandering to the lowest common denominator should be
but also if all these movies make a billion dollars then its ok because it keeps movies theaters afloat even tho it doesnt really
i think its more that "lowest common denominator" is on the global scale now
i mean yeah the lead in that the lowest common denominator is their actual audience anyways LOL
so even if u make only $30 million here you can make a $100 million overseas if you do well in china and pick up a few million everywhere else
https://twitter.com/blakeyrat/status/990296661065977857
stuff like that
lets not even acknowledge we have characters
just put em in and the audience will figure it ou
or not fuck em
im pulled because i nut to filmmakers integrity
i guess if youre guaranteed to make $1 billion you dont have to try anymore
fair
i guess its only so <:concerned:368837468528705536> to me because these arent high art pieces that dont pander to the lowest common denominator because they have a specific image they want to achieve
its a blowup haha fun time movie that for some reason refuses to allow the greater public to enjoy it
so when its billed as the BIGGEST MOVIE OF THE DECADE
idk its a mostly moot point
everybody that cares is keeping up
and those of us that dont just dont go
there is something fucked in there
this is what capitalism looks like in the internet age üòî
you arent selling a product or service now its all about selling a brand (im sure it was always about brand recognition but now the product doesnt even matter lol)
we live in the timeline where people will buy a product or service because they think it'll help in the battle against somebody with an opposing political opinion
that mostly has nothing to do with marvel movies but still makes me lol
black panther was kind of that tbh
altho to be fair that was a more groundbreaking moment
compared to something like ghostbusters 2016
are you trying to im ply that Ryan Coogler, already prolific black director was scamming his audience
u better not or ur getting the ‚úä
Fruitvale Station and Creed are fucking incredible movies and i wont stand for this <:kermit:394547357351542784> ü§õ
üòî
maybe i was thinking more of the "if u dont like this movie ur a racist" camp
also <@!150802630677889025> mfw iw killed black panther and disney are gonna force them to bring him back
i didnt see any of the if u dont like this movie ur a racist takes tbh
i saw the this is a proudly black movie not made *for* white people so a white person not appreciating it doesnt really matter which i mean is whatever
but there were more peiople saying "IF U DONT LIKE IT IM A RACIST IM NOT A RACXIST" then there were people accusing people of being racist
<:dolbob:427651794492194827>
it could have been that yeah
also tfw i know ive seen fruitvale station before but i dont really remember anything about it
see it again
the ending is insane
Granted, the ouctome itself is tragic but everything that is related before, those contemplative day-to-day life scenes, has no direct connection with it and 90% of the script therefore turn out to be almost pointless

why dont we talk about this panel more
or are they all this
is that supposed to be their wedding
wheres the other angel where it shows ethan in a tux
who
i thought he was tim
or wait tim buckley is the folk singer
right
yeah who tf is the <:loss:326500572939419649> guy
thats ethan
the writer is tim buckley
ethan <:wildwoody5:376939786876747776>
bradberry ü§£
not related to tim buckley the singer
tim buckley's really good btw i finally checked him out and <:wildwoody6:376940918965665804>
<:loss:326500572939419649> me trying to stop my real self from interviewing jordan peterson
interview him and ask him how he feels about being using to groom alt right white supremacists
speaking of the takeaway i got from this kanye maga situation is reading the twitter responses
ethan would ask how he does it <:ilikethesoundofthat:346754449496211469>
because we're getting a real time window into how these people operate
it started with candace owens and then you got a lot of people encouraging him and trying to bring him farther over
every time @kayne trending because they kept spelling his name wrong
lmao
but i mean it some of those comments were really <:concerned:368837468528705536>
theyer putting their behind closed doors grooming on full display because they dont have a way to privately reach him
so its a lot of positive encouragement and agreements and linking other speakers to follow
too bad nobodys gonna actually notice
tfw dont have enough followers to bring it to people's attentions
maybe ill make a
<:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553> facebook post <:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>
also tfw joy ann reid is making people not trust web archives because she doesnt want to admit she was homophobic once
maybe i should reach out to a publication to run the story
liek buzzfeed <:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>
make a medium article
im gonna do that
but yeah blaming your previous homophobic posts on russian bots hacking archived web posts is pretty <:impetus:397545192296808448>
<:impetus:397545192296808448>
medium has open messages so im gonna send one
some smwc people have made medium articles so you can prolly do it
plus yours is political <:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>
wtf how and why
do they let anybody do it
also derpy does that mean that nobody actually reads medium
what's medium
idk lol

this is a weird situation
hes upset he isnt getting acknowledged for creating the character
but what is he expecting
it is weird that he wasnt even aware it was beign remastered tho
until he saw the release trailer
that kind of sucks
tfw ur creation gets remastered by somebody else and nobody told u
didnt something like that happen with the shadow of the colossus remaster earlier this year
they offered to help but sony said no or somethin
well it happened with crash when the exact same thing happened
to the same person
<:kermit:394547357351542784>
he sounds super entitled but he also probably wants a job
which is fair
mfw i was gonna buy parallel lines separately from google play but they dont even have it on their store
FUCK YOU blondie guess i'll pirate your album then
>blondie
reminder blondie was the first person to rap on an album
that gets me mad u cant complain about piracy if u do this shit
(not blondie specifically but in general)
who complains about piracy
besides metallica
don henley probably
hes taken down anything eagles/solo related on youtube and also butchered everything on digital
he also thinks sampling is stealing <:concerned:368837468528705536>

he got pretty far before he had to settle on "i just dont like him" when nobody fed into his shit
LOL
their entire argument is based on "kojima would rather be making movies"
you mean the only kojima argument
and that he ignores everybody's contributions but his own
but didnt he have a suggestion box and force employees to write to it every week
and thats where the cover mechanics came from or some shit

im gonna wear it out tonight and hopefully be the belle of the ball ‚ò∫
stuff like this pisses me off tho because you see all the comments are on chris' side and people that actually read the article / played the game have to clarify that hes objectively wrong
like apparently the game director did not reference toxic masculinity, the interviewer asked him about it and he gave his answer
im just sick of these influencers not acknowledging the actual power they have over their audience
we gotta be the change

this orange creamsicle beer is a big FAIL

I just reacted to a super religious uncle's subtle (more like blatant) homophobic post on facebook with a sad face
I wonder what will happen if he notices
<@!256056394476683265> the nudes girl has a crush on me so i dont get nudes any more üòî
i just get called cute and get heart eyes
you shouldn't get nudes if you don't want anything with her!
but what if i want
nudes <:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>
I mean I'm all for modern relationships and uncompromised sex and all that
the problem here is you're giving her nothing in return other than disappointment lol
you should suggest exchanging nudes <:ilikethesoundofthat:346754449496211469>
im givng her my verganty which is apparently all she really wants anyways
until she caught the feelings
verganty <:kermitthinks:394548147382255618>
idk its probably more the concept of getting nudes (somebody thin king about u enough to get nude and give them over) then actually getting them if that makes sense
shes back in my city tho so i guess i can always reach out
i sent her a message at 3am lol that said i missed her nudes and she reacted with heart eyes and said im so cute she cant even
so im giving up
lol
i dont want to be cute!!!!!!!!!!!! i wanna be cool ‚òπ
being cute is good

bit <:concerned:368837468528705536> about this movie
tfw your love may not be reciprocal üòî
just prove ur worth üòÉ
my bigger concern is he's not gay lol
I'm pretty sure he can at least endure me but that's not enough
show him a wiener and ask for his thoughts <:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>
tfw he tells you about the time his best friend casually asked him "if i were gay would u date me" and he got scared off
was that you <:wildwoody2:368845220487364628>
I can't believe he's going to go through that twice in his life
if he's hetero that's hilarious
guys jacking off in chaturbate was the second sexual revolution
he's a guy magnet
guy magnet üò≥
speaking of im going to a gay dance party tonight üíÉ
i love gay dance parties because theres no pressure
so far I only attract gay men rip
you just dance and have fun an d theres no real hostility towards anybody
and by gay men I mean one bi dude
his other friend has a girlfriend now
like girls dont have to be afraid and they get to talk to people ‚ò∫
so he's more like a bi magnet
my opening line is, i go "bi or die!" and i show them my knife
and then i kiss them üò≥

ive met a lot of cool people but im always too drunk to actually follow up or make friends

thanos wins
im no comic book enthusiast who knows alot about the marvel universe but thanoss's race sounds like a bunch of idiots given how they built the plot. they died of starvation and a loss of resources how does an advanced rac not know the slightest about genetic modification to make some fast growing crops and if it is energy related the friggin dwarf had acess to a dyson sphere which im assuming thanos's race would aswell, and maybe rather than killing half the universe he can provide relief and educate other races rather than going full out 70s america and napalming half them and going your welcome citizen.
hes right u know
also wtf this movie has 17 writing credits
<:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>
are most of them comic book authors
i cant see who they are because imdb's dumbass splash screen literally covers them up
<:concerned:368837468528705536>
its oddly sketchy because its covers the writers but not the actors???
Christopher Markus ... (screenplay by) & Stephen McFeely ... (screenplay by) Stan Lee ... (based on the Marvel comics by) and Jack Kirby ... (based on the comics by) Joe Simon ...

and he reviews old movies
two sheep break out of a prison
and screams a lot
and we call it "on the lamb"
<@!256056394476683265> is it a nickname-like last name or just a straight up actual last name except it's not the real one
we call him
<:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>
the nostalgia critic
has that been used yet
my ideas better
it's an actual last name she doesn't have

I just noticed that tiny baby is called "screaming hairy armadillo" and now I want to see it scream
is that what andean means
lets make the main character a glass frog
i want a show about a frog
i love frog
the catch is that it's gonna be traditionally animated and all of its organs will have to be animated whenever he's on screen
what if
we had a dog
o glass frog
and he had a blog
i like glass frog
and we called it
dog with a blog
his catchphrase can be "IM FRAGILE"
what if they made a new muppet show
glass frog would be animated hell but also pretty neat
derpy how long did that last
and its called
frog with a hog
@ dog with a blog
3 seasons
but how
69 EPISODES
lol i guessed right

did iw kill everybody to leave room in the roster for x-men
talk to someone that makes you happy
talk to people with more positive mindsets, too
i know some people use jokes like "I want to die" as a way of coping, but in my experience hanging out with people are happier tends to have a better effect
also no to alcohol
as a coping mechanism
that's like using a cinder block to try and not drown

holy moly (thread)
the person id talk to to make me happy cheated on me
???
leods a fucking awful person
jesus
<@!315223082077782018> wait what hillside is fucking awesome this year
tho i dont think thats actually faust cuz capitalization?
okay its not like super crazy i gues but theres enough
nvm it is faust wtf
tbh faust and messthetics alone is enough for me. not that the messthetics album was like, incredible but it was pretty good and its brendan canty and joe lally
i totally glossed over this lineup without noticing faust before tbh. theres enough interesting stuff that i'd probably be able to do the full weekend tho there's a lot of bland indie rock too
whats the lineup
http://hillsidefestival.ca/events/hillside-summer-festival-2018 not like super crazy but its close and cheap and has enough that if i can convince some friends to camp with me ill do it
reminds me that i never checked out jessica moss' solo album
i feel awful
i wish i was dead
oh fuck
wavee this fucking sucks. please stay strong. I don't feel like I can help a lot but I really hope that you will get through this
probably why the bastard left, too
ü§î
I'm really sorry, though
I'm not caught up, is abby his bot?
it should be gone if so
I mean I personally don't enjoy the bot, but you guys seem to have fun with it
i swear I remember the bot being his though
wouldn't it leave with him?
thanks
it is his
he asked me if he should leave it and i said sure since people like it
so he can spy on the place
<@!145035244691521536> yeah i was staring at faUSt for a long ass time trying to find some semblance of evidence that it was a US cover band but nope! The real band
<:kermitthinks:394548147382255618>
you have to realize that leod left voluntarily
the only bands i know are faust and destroyer but like you said thats enough for me to justify the trip
no one kicked him out
ya i looked at the blurb about them on the festival's page and "krautrock legends"
i went to their website, then to wikipedia
messthetics is fugazi's rhythm section with a jazz guitarist
and jessica moss is in thee silver mount zion. and US girls are good
LOL you've sold me
his bot is still here though
and yeah ill dig through for other shit i like lol
i was sold on hillside being entirely comprised of hippies so this line-up is fuckn with my head a bit
i assumed it was 30 literally who bands but if they're actually good ill have to do some research üîç <:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>
i mean theres a few bigish indie bands e.g. hollerado
who are good live if you like their music tho not really my cup of tea
cadence weapon is prolly a top 10 canadian rapper (lmao)
lmao cant forget hollerado üíÉ
I know it's not any of my business, but having been cheated on myself in the past I can't help but be upset with him
based on names and photos i think half of this lineup has probably won juno awards
or at least been nominated
juno üò©
still though, if you guys enjoy the bot then I really see no reason why to not keep it
i remember one year andrew jackson jihad were playing and it killed me that i couldnt go and my friend called me at work so i could hear them and it just made me feel worse about not getting to be there
im glad i have weekends off now and it makes it so fuckn hard to justify quitting lol
I see a reason but fine, I don't have the energy to argue against leods anymore
im about to get back on my 9 to 5 starting tomorrow. i did fuckall in my week off but still wish i took more lol
never done me any good
but im taking all of august off so whatever
I get the whole spy thing, don't get me wrong
nice
weekends off is good tho ya
I just don't know how bots work whatsoever
i slept for 12 hours saturday and 10 hours today
feels good
and how in-depth that sort of thing gets
me neither but he can clearly read messages
the whole spying thing sounds a bit ridiculous, but it makes a lot more sense for abby to be gone
it doesn't sound that ridiculous to me coming from whom it's coming honestly
also i went to a gay dance party and this scary dude with a lazy eye that looked like tj miller kept eyeing me up and it made me really uncomfortable
well, yeah
I'll give you that
normally i'd be down to dance with him but i was sober because no money LOL
LOL
who here would be really upset with the bot gone
but i also üíÉ busted a move üíÉ twice in a dancing circle and got thunderous applause which is all you can really ask for
nice
I personally don't care either way. I don't particularly enjoy bots, but some people here do
I would be stunned if it's decided that it stays
i like dancing
i have a business card some random lady at an art gallery gave me for a mysterious dance party happening tonight
it doesnt have a location only a date so idk how im supposed to find it
let dance guide u
follow yr feet
if thats the idea i cant go LOL maybe there's a clue on the card üëÄ
*It's a spiritual thing... A body thing... A soul thing!*
<:thnok:286580013187203073>

its probably my favourite song from the game
its weird tho because its never really associated with being *the* theme from the game
DERPY dingdong has new life breathed into him
and Julian is still good
<:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>
if only chris wasnt there
its forcing chris to be positive too actually
i think its just too easy for him to sink into cynicism with zack and niall tbh
why did he just complain about games with them
since they just immediately disconnect from the game and basically leave chris all alone
<:concerned:368837468528705536>
good show
so chris is the only one really focused on the game and he has to try to make it entertaining
well w/e its for the people that treat lets plays as podcasts üò©
<:joneatscum:368833951579504640>
but yeah all of dingdongs training with streaming has prepared him for this moment
I'll watch it when I get home
do it
yeah idk i think it really is that zack and niall dont give a FUCK about the game so its like chris is their younger brother trying to get them to think hes cool while they're off doing their own thing talking about circumcisions
i guess a good way to think about it is that zack and niall still treat it like theyre recording sleepycast and chris is trying to do a lets play
so he has to juggle both
>chris brings up trump

https://youtu.be/xMaETFe4yfI?t=119 why the fuck is filthy frank on jimmy fallon
and what do we get out of keeping a bot from someone shitty is my question
may the first be with you
tfw jimmy fallon is resorting to youtube weirdos
thats a different argument
doesnt have to do with my input
why do u say hes shitty
he didnt cheat
wavee is being a crybaby
dont shit talk him just cause shes being emotional and said exaggerated things
<@!256056394476683265>
I should've guessed
he's never wrong
im not
saying hes never wrong
im just saying
you dont know everything
no, i actually know
because i literally know the person it was with
and i know it from them
and i also know it literally from him admitting to me
but if you wanna talk out of your ass you can do that too, medic
i literally know everything here because i spent like 3 hours talking to leod directly and he told me everything that was up. he left here on his own accord, he felt like shit, but he did indeed cheat on wavee with another girl in a server i'm in who's a close friend of mine (she had no idea he was with someone), and she was the one who first came to me telling me she was beginning something with leod (which she meant in an innocent way, and which made me realize what leod was doing)
but yeah medic, youre on some real victim blaming shit. it's pretty fucking gross and you're pretty fucking gross
"you don't know everything" is not an excuse for telling someone their experiences did not happen and confidently saying he did not cheat
well you have gay
bitch
ok thats not what he told me tho
what did he say to you?
ok listen first of all i didnt blame any victims
is emotional not the right term
he told me
that he'd found someone else and broke up with wavee and he broke up with her cause of the new person
but that hed been meaning to break up with her
thats true, but he did neglect to say he already initiated something with that person for a few weeks while still dating wavee and telling her he loved her and whatever else when he didnt mean it
because he said he let things get out of his control until he was in over his head
ok but i dont htink its fair to call him a shitty person over this
ü§∑
i told him he has a lot of his own personal shit he needs to work on to be a better person
id like to say my discussion with him was more constructive than anything
but i think other people are valid to think what they do
i dont see how jumping from partner to partner as soon as you get bored of someone doesnt make someone bad anyways
because most people are like this
i mean
that doesnt make it ok
but im not gonna hate him for it

dam
i dont think its fair to lie to me and tell me you love me then flirt with other people behind my back
I think one thing that's important in relationships is honesty. if he didn't feel passionate about you anymore he should've opened up about it
then again this is a common mistake and a major factor for relationships that don't end well
man i didnt think about the fact that incredibles 2 is coming out in a post-iron man world
compared to the first one
wonder if thats gonna change anything
i saw people crying that its a cuck movie focusing on women
is this true
<:kermitthinks:394548147382255618>
its just genderswapped incredibles basically
mom does the superhero stuff while dad stays at home
fahmy cuz dad is bad with kids
ok but
in the original incredibles
wasnt mom a superhero too
i don't remember it
but im pretty sure the sister and the mom had super powers too
no you are ruining the narrative <:angery:368840579418816532>
i mean it was focused on the dude but it was kinda like he was a big dumbass and the black guy and the wife had to save him?
thats what i remember
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qam4w8LTlEQ
how many fuckin superheroes are there
<@!150802630677889025> didnt click because vice but is matt groening groaning about sjws
he said its the trend that people pretend to be offended nowadays
o
i mean he's not wrong then üòÉ
did u follow that dress scandal
what dress scandal
a white girl wore a ~beautiful~ (it was very nice) chinese dress to prom
and some boy was like "my CULTURE is not your PROM DRESS" and cries of racism were thrown
there's a kind of poetry in that all of the people calling the girl out were also white and the actual chinese people didnt understand why everybody was so mad
and the guy that originally called the prom dress out sure had a lot of tweets about n <:fleshed:439910419801440257> ggers
<:pork:427639109935300618>
it was a good time
tfw u work on something for a week and then realize its all a waste of time <:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>
i didnt even know it was controversial because the only tweet i saw about it was RicePirate saying he was happy to see his culture being represented in NA
but then i saw the news and ya it was racist
because the girl hilariously did not give a solitary FUCK about its origins
she just thought it looked nice
so white twitter Ho A was like "i hope you took asian culture's long, rich history into account before wearing this dress
and wholesome white twitter Ho B was like "nope! i just thought it was really cute! üòä "
thot more like
That Ho On twitter
<:pork:427639109935300618>
The Ho-Oh Team
https://youtu.be/q3Yl4ehzX-o this is a really good song
FUCK this is a good song
ya <:nowTHATSwhatimtalkingabout:366799069621911553>
apparently they wrote it in an hour
and it wasnt even supposed to be on the album
so it was originally a **HIDDEN TRACK** <:wildwoody2:368845220487364628>
train in vain is so good
i mean the whole album is good
but thats in the top 3
i listened to it when i was a prude <:garf:368832937610838018> boy
so i only liked brand new cadillac
and lost in the supermarket
spanish bombs is my favorite
theres somethign to say about listening to this album once literally once and still remembering how a lot of them go
london calling, spanish bomb, supermarket, cadillac, guns over brixton
the list really goes on
i wish i was in a cool punk band that wrote double LP's
bands like the clash or the minutemen or husker du that just write these massive albums in like 2 days
Though London Calling was released as a double album it was only sold for about the price of a single album. The Clash's record label, CBS, at first denied the band's request for the album to be released as a double. In return CBS gave permission for the band to include a free 12-inch single that played at 33‚Öì rpm. Ultimately, the planned 12-inch record became a second nine-track LP.
like the minutemen having enough content for 1 album finding out husker du was doing a double album and saying "o no u du not ( <:wildwoody5:376939786876747776> )" and just writing another 20 or so songs on the spot
<:wildwoody6:376940918965665804>
<:wildwoody6:376940918965665804>
derpy idk if u know husker du
but zen arcade
they recorded in like 2 hours
i know the name
DAM
its a double album worth listening to
its a concept album about a punk going into an alternate dimension or some shit read the wiki description on it
o its already in my squad picks playlist
it has acoustic guitars and a lot of psychedelic influence which was unheard of for a hardcore band
back then the rules weer
- if you dont sound like black flag, we hate you and your shitty band
GOD I LOVE MUSIC
